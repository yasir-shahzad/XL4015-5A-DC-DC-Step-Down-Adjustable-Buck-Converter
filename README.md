## Example Applications

### 1. Battery Charging
Adjust the output voltage to match the charging voltage of your battery (e.g., 4.2V for a single Li-ion cell). Use additional circuitry for current regulation if necessary.

### 2. Voltage Regulator for Microcontrollers
Supply a steady voltage (e.g., 5V or 3.3V) for Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or other embedded systems.

### 3. LED Driver
Drive LEDs with a constant and adjustable voltage. Ensure to calculate proper current-limiting resistors.
